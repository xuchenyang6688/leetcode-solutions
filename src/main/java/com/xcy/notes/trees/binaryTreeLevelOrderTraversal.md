3. Connect all nodes at same level (next pointer)
4. Find rightmost node at each level (right side view)
5. Find largest/smallest/average value at each level
6. Implement level order using DFS instead of BFS
7. Handle N-ary trees (more than 2 children per node)
8. Find minimum/maximum depth using level order

Pattern: Level order traversal is fundamental BFS on trees.
Many tree problems can be solved by adapting this basic pattern
to collect, process, or analyze nodes level by level.
